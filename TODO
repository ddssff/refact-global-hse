   2. Convert tests in tests/Tests.hs into real tests
   7. Test cases:
         test moving a decl to a new module
         move a decl to a module that imported it (decl1)
         move a decl to a module that didn't import it
         move a decl that is referenced
         move a decl that is unreferenced
   11. Why does it sometimes insert the same import several times?
   15. New modules need to inherit the LANGUAGE parameters of all the
       departure modules.
   16. Arrival modules also need new LANGUAGE pragmas from departure modules.
   17. Make sure there is at least a newline after the last import, and afer
       the end of the exports.
   18. Fix bad ModuleKey values in this:
   19. Get rid of adjustSpans, FoldM module
   20. In decl3 a Tmp.hs file with no declarations ought to exist after the test

          runhaskell scripts/Clean --move=withCurrentDirectory,IO,Utils --move=replaceFile,IO,Utils --find=. --find=scripts --find=tests


DONE

 * 1. Create new modules
 * 3. Make a nice executable for moving decls, including instances
 * 8. Merge IO into Utils
