   2. Convert tests in tests/Tests.hs into real tests
   7. Test cases:
         test moving a decl to a new module
         move a decl to a module that imported it (decl1)
         move a decl to a module that didn't import it
         move a decl that is referenced
         move a decl that is unreferenced
   20. In decl3 a Tmp.hs file with no declarations ought to exist after the test

          runhaskell scripts/Clean --move=withCurrentDirectory,IO,Utils --move=replaceFile,IO,Utils --find=. --find=scripts --find=tests

   22. Make the string scanning code more efficient
   24. decl1: Why no export of tryfindM in Decls.hs?
   25. Doing decl7 in "real" source directory gives strange errors
       starts at start of first decl instead of end of last import.
   28. Should there be options to modify imports of library modules that were
       previously changed using Move.hs?  You could use them to document how
       to upgrade clients of your library.  Eh.
   32. Change qualified uses of the symbols of moving declarations
   33. Global symbol rename
   34. Identity transform: Turn concrete type into a type parameter
   36: Global elimination of exports
   37. CPP

DONE

 * 1. Create new modules
 * 3. Make a nice executable for moving decls, including instances
 * 8. Merge IO into Utils
 * 15. New modules need to inherit the LANGUAGE parameters of all the
       departure modules.
 * 16. Arrival modules also need new LANGUAGE pragmas from departure modules.
 * 17. Make sure there is at least a newline after the last import, and afer
       the end of the exports.
 * 19. Get rid of adjustSpans, FoldM module
 * 26. decl5: comment of first declaration not removed on departure - point
 * 27: decl4:
          1. missing newline before symbolsDeclaredBy block comment
          2. Comment of a FoldDeclaredBy instance left at EOF
          3. extra newline before class FoldDeclared block comment
          4. symbolsDeclaredBy block comment moved to Tmp
   29. Use fmap (const ()) instead of the simplify types
   30. Add Scoped to SrcSpanInfo
 * 31. Use Scoped info instead of FoldDeclared, HasSymbols, HasCNames, and to implement moveType
 * 35. Export symbols that arrive via Up moves
