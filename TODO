 * 1. Create new modules
   2. Convert tests in tests/Tests.hs into real tests
 * 3. Make a nice executable for moving decls, including instances
   4. Add ways to break circular imports
   5. Intra-decl transformations - (collect ideas)
          * Move a condition into the called function:

              when flag action
              action = foo

            becomes

              action flag
   	   action flag = when flag foo

          * Expand the condition:

              action (f a b)
   	   action flag = when flag foo

            becomes

              action a b
   	   action a b = when (f a b) foo

   6. Remove modules that become empty
   7. Test cases:
         test moving a decl to a new module
         move a decl to a module that imported it (decl1)
         move a decl to a module that didn't import it
         move a decl that is referenced
         move a decl that is unreferenced
   8. Merge IO into Utils
   9. For an IDE we will need to be able to specify where to put the
      declaration, it can't always go at the end.
   11. Why does it sometimes insert the same import several times?
   12. Do global tests - is this symbol imported anywhere?  If not remove
       its export.
   13. If moving a decl creates a circular import, can we find additional
       decls to move that resolves the situation?
