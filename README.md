# What it does

 * It moves declarations between modules
 * It globally updates imports of those declarations
 * It minimizes the imports of all modified modules
 * It retains all comments and white space outside of the import list
 * It leaves code in #if alone

# Requirements

 The only requirement currently not in hackage is filemanip >= 0.3.6.4,
 you may get it from https://github.com/ddssff/filemanip.  It fixes a
 bug where the find function doesn't notice working directory changes.

# How To

 1. There are scripts to do simple import cleaning and declaration moving:

    $ runhaskell scripts/Clean.hs --help
    $ runhaskell scripts/Move.hs --help

 (Does not handle instances.)

 2. Use the interpreter.  Best examples are in the test suite.  Make sure
    your file permissions are set up so you can read the .ghci script:

    $ chmod g-w . .ghci
    $ ghci

# Reformatted import lists

I know many people have particular opinions about the formatting of
import lists.  Unfortunately, this tool will reformat your import list
in a very specific way, which is probably not exactly what you prefer.
However, consider that things are different when you have a tool
maintaining your import list, and the generated format has some
advantages.  The modules are alphabetized, and the symbols are also
alphabetized and fully expanded.  This makes locating symbols very
easy, and lets you know if you need to insert a new one.  If you need
a symbol that isn't imported and know what module it is in, just
delete the symbol list and start using the symbol.  The tool will find
it for you the next time it runs.
